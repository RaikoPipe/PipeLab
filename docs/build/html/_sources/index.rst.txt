=================================================
The PipeLab Module consists of several submodules and classes. It uses type aliases for easier comprehension of complex types,
which can be found in :ref:`type dictionary <Type Dictionary>`. The most important modules are the :ref:`OPC-UA server <OPC_UA>`
and the :ref:`GUI for debugging and visualization <Function Test>`.
