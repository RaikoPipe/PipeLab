Path Finding
===============

This module contains the :ref:`search algorithm <Search Algorithm module>` and its :ref:`utility functions <Path Finding Utility module>` for solving path finding problems.

The :ref:`partial solver <Partial Solver module>` can solve for multiple related path problems to deduce a total solution.

:ref:`Dataclasses <Path Finding Dataclasses>` are used to describe path problems and solutions.
